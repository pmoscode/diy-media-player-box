= DIY Media Player Box - UI

This is the UI part of the DIY Media Player Box.
You can use the https://gitlab.com/pmoscode/diy-media-player-box-backend[Backend repo] to Build it completely.

This you can use, if you want to separate the UI and the backend. Usually the UI is served by the application server of the backend.

The UI is build with Angular 11.
